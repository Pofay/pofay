Hello everyone, my name is Gian Carlo I. Gilos. A Software Developer living in the Philippines.

I'm currently working for [International Systems Research (ISR)][1] as a Junior Java Developer.

Not that more to say at the moment but I do have these hobbies when I'm not writing games or programs:

- Grappling (From Jiu-jitsu to Wrestling) but due to COVID-19 restrictions is on hold.
- Playing Computer Games with Friends (Deep Rock Galactic anyone?)
- 3D Modelling in Blender (Low-poly). Currently working towards Animations and Rigging.
