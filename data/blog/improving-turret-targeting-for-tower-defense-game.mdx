# Introduction

Hello everyone `Pofay` here with another article.

If you've played my [tower defense game][tower-defense] you might notice one issue that ticks you off (there are a lot of them actually.) but one stands out in terms of gameplay.

The gameplay issue **is how slow the turret changes targets whenever its current target dies**. It sometimes takes a second or two before it can switch targets.

This causes low hp targets a chance to slip past the turret and reach the goal. This is due to the current implementation of the `TurretTargeting.cs` script attached in all turrets.

You can view the code for the game [here.][github]

# Context

When I started making the game I followed [Brackey's Tutorial on making a Tower Defense Game.][brackeys]

I followed what the features of the tutorial showed but I wrote the code with my own style.

But there was one thing back then that I couldn't change to fit my standards, which was the algorithm for the turrets to find a target.

```csharp
// TurretTargeting.cs
public Transform CalculateNextTarget(float range)
{
    // 1. Query GameObjects that have the "Enemies" tag.
    var enemies = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(targetTag);
    var shortestDistance = Mathf.Infinity;
    GameObject nearestEnemy = null;
    // 2. Perform Distance calculation
    foreach (var enemy in enemies)
    {
        var distanceToEnemy = Vector3.Distance(transform.position, enemy.transform.position);
        // 3. Set current target based on shortest distance
        if (distanceToEnemy < shortestDistance)
        {
            shortestDistance = distanceToEnemy;
            nearestEnemy = enemy;
        }
    }
    // 4. Check if target is in range and is still alive.
    if (nearestEnemy != null && IsInRange(shortestDistance, range)
        && nearestEnemy.GetComponent<EnemyHealth>().isActiveAndEnabled)
    {
        return nearestEnemy.transform;
    }
    else
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```

The main problem with this algorithm is at step 1 and step 2. Provided you have 100-150 enemies in your scene:

- Each tower has to query all enemies in the scene (including the disabled ones)
- Each tower has to run a distance calculation on all enemies before finding the right target.

This isn't a major issue if the number of enemies in your scene are static. (not spawned using code)

But for a scenario like this game where its spawning enemies in intervals (via script) then it just doesn't fit.

# The Fix

The fix for the issue was to change how the script queries the enemies.

Instead of querying them all I decided to use `Physics.OverlapSphere` to make the tower only get the enemies near its range.

This makes the number of enemies in the distance calculaton loop lower than the previous implementation. (I don't have the exact numbers though.)

```csharp
public Transform CalculateNextTarget(float range)
{
    // 1. Query targets near range of tower
    var possibleTargets = Physics.OverlapSphere(transform.position, range, targetMask);
    var shortestDistance = Mathf.Infinity;
    GameObject nearestTarget = null;
    // 2. Perform distance calculation
    foreach (var target in possibleTargets)
    {
        var distanceToEnemy = Vector3.Distance(transform.position, target.transform.position);
        // 3. Set current target based on distance
        if (distanceToEnemy < shortestDistance)
        {
            shortestDistance = distanceToEnemy;
            nearestTarget = target.gameObject;
        }
    }
    // 4. Check if target is in range and is still alive.
    if (nearestTarget != null && IsInRange(shortestDistance, range)
        && nearestTarget.GetComponent<EnemyHealth>().isActiveAndEnabled)
    {
        return nearestTarget.transform;
    }
    else
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Playing it again and now the turrets switch targets faster when its current target dies.

# Ending thoughts

Although I'm not that versed on performance, I could see its effects if you neglect it on this game.

This was a lesson for me to take performance into account when writing games and pretty much any type of software that needs it.

With that said there's still a number of issues in the game that I may yet tackle:

- Rapid instantiation/Destruction of Projectiles (which can be solved by pooling)
- Alt-tabbing causes screen to move to current mouse position
- Sound keeps playing even when paused.

And a number of improvements:

- Change VFX (since I bought a new pack.)
- Improve lighting and post-processing

Until then, happy coding.

_(P.S as of writing this post the fix is live on the [current itch.io page][itchio])_
