Hello this is Gian Carlo Gilos aka `pofay` and welcome to my new blog.

Trying out the features of this starter.

# Introduction

I previously had a blog using [`jekyll`](https://pofay.github.io) but I stopped blogging on it back in 2019 due to the lack of commitment and I really didn't like working with its templating to make my own pages.

I needed a framework that used `react.js` as a means to write the Layout of the pages. Back then it was `Gatsby.js` that I picked up and decided to deploy it to `Now` which was `Vercel` back in the day.

But again due to the lack of commitment the blog dried up and sat in the closet for about 2 years.

Now that I'm currently working however I realized that I should've been more active in posting what I was learning, since most of my friends who actively blogged were much more sought out by potential employers.

Most professional resources such as [egghead.io][2] also recommend making a blog for publicity and portfolio purposes.

With those thoughts in mind I figured that I needed to use my and edit my [old blog](https://pofay-blog.vercel.app)

When I tried bringing it back alive however, I just stopped midway due to the numerous issues found by `dependabot` and the staleness of settings. I mean it was off for 2 years so there's that.

I could've have fixed it but I really wanted a place to write without having the issues of configuration at the moment.

I thought I could use another `Gatsby.js` starter but due to them in the process of updating to V4 I was hesitant due to the extra configurations.

I looked up some boilerplates using `react` and came across the [NextJS Tailwind starter blog][1] and decided to use it for my blogging purposes.

I used it because of the following:

- It has dark mode builtin
- Uses `react.js`
- Tight integration with `Vercel`
- The code is simple enough to extend.
- To Learn more about NextJS

The 4th point is very good since in the long run since I can change the overall theme and functionality of this blog.

During the course of the blog's setup I spotted a small issue on its disqus configuration in `Disqus.js`.

```js
// in siteMetadata its disqus configuration is named disqusConfig instead of disqus
script.src = 'https://' + siteMetadata.comment.disqus.shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'
script.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date())
script.setAttribute('crossorigin', 'anonymous') // Need to comment or remove the line below to fix Disqus CORS issue
```

Which should've been:

```js
script.src = 'https://' + siteMetadata.comment.disqusConfig.shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'
script.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date())
```

## What I'll be writing from now on

My old blog/s used to have more posts about hardware using arduino and the raspberry pi.

But recently I'm much more engrossed on the following:

- Game Development using Unity
- Relearning React and Javascript(new Hooks API for a lot of libraries)
- A bit of Java (since I'm working as a Java Developer at the moment.)

## Side note

I also recently released a [Tower Defense Game in itch.io][3] which will be the focus of my topics in the succeeding days.
