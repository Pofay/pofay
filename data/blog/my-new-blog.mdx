Hello, this is Gian Carlo Gilos aka `Pofay`, and welcome to my new blog.

This post serves as a demo for me on the features of this starter.

# Introduction

I previously had a blog using [`Jekyll`](https://pofay.github.io) but I stopped blogging on it back in 2019 due to the lack of commitment and I didn't like working with its templating language to make my custom pages.

I needed a framework that used `react.js` as a means to write the layout of the pages. Back then it was `Gatsby.js` that I picked up and decided to deploy it to `Now` which was `Vercel` back in the day.

But again due to the lack of commitment, the blog dried up and sat in the closet for about 2 years.

Now that I'm currently working however I realized that I should've been more active in posting what I was learning since most of my friends who actively blogged were much more sought out by potential employers.

Most professional resources such as [egghead.io][2] also recommend making a blog for publicity and portfolio purposes. With those thoughts in mind, I figured that I needed to use and edit my [old blog.](https://pofay-blog.vercel.app)

When I tried to set it up, however, I was swarmed with numerous issues found by `Dependabot` and the staleness of settings brought about a lot of headaches, especially because of the node version. I mean it was off for 2 years so there's that.

I could've fixed it but I wanted a place to write without having the issues of configuration at the moment. I thought about using another `Gatsby.js` starter but due to it being in the process of updating to V4 I was hesitant due to the extra configurations that will eventually come up.

It was then I looked up some boilerplates using `react` and came across the [NextJS Tailwind starter blog.][1]

I decided to make use of it because of the following:

- It has dark mode builtin
- Uses `react.js`
- Tight integration with [`Vercel`][4]
- The code is simple enough to extend.
- To learn about `NextJS`

Because of the 4th point I am confident that I can change the theme or add functionalities to this blog.

I did encounter a problem during the blog's setup. Its a small issue on its Disqus configuration in `Disqus.js`.

```js
// in siteMetadata its disqus configuration is named disqusConfig instead of disqus
script.src = 'https://' + siteMetadata.comment.disqus.shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'
script.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date())
script.setAttribute('crossorigin', 'anonymous') // Need to comment or remove the line below to fix Disqus CORS issue
```

Which can be fixed by changing the lines above to this:

```js
script.src = 'https://' + siteMetadata.comment.disqusConfig.shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'
script.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date())
```

## What I'll be writing from now on

My old blog/s used to have more posts about hardware using Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.

But recently I'm much more engrossed in the following:

- Game Development using Unity (since I'm currently building 3D Games on the side as a Hobby)
- Relearning React and Javascript (new Hooks API for a lot of libraries)
- A bit of Java (since I'm working as a Java Developer at the moment.)

## Side note

I also recently released a [Tower Defense Game in itch.io][3] which will be the focus of my topics in the succeeding days.
