> Before following along with this article please setup your [Arduino][arduino] for [Johnny Five][j5]. The full setup guide is [here][arduino-j5-setup]

[Johnny Five][j5] is a really cool framework that allows you to use Javascript code to control [supported boards][supported] ranging from an arduino to a raspberry pi.

For Arduino the setup is pretty easy but the constraints are as follows:

> The JavaScript program is executed on a host machine that runs Node.js. The program transmits basic IO instructions to the board via usb serial, which acts as a thin client. Requires tethering.

Which means your **Arduino must be connected at all times to the host machine so that the code can run**.

This is unlike the traditional method of **upload and forget** when using base Arduino.

Although this drawback can be mitigated by using a Raspberry Pi alongside the Arduino. But I want to use just the Arduino to do stuff using Javascript.

Thats when I found this [link][hc-05-link] for using a [HC-05][hc-05] bluetooth module to act as a wireless serial port.

Although theres a number of things that the guide in the link omitted. Like where is the **key pin** on a HC-05.

And that you have to use a **Bluetooth Manager** to actually let the device be seen as a **serial port**.

Today I will explain to you how I set this up on my host computer running [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS][ubuntu-18.04].

## Hardware Used

- [Arduino Uno REV 3][arduino-uno].
- [HC-05 Bluetooth][hc-05]

## The base setup

So first off we need to send AT commands to the HC-05. In order for us to do that we need to do this connection:

**With Bluetooth RX to PIN 11 and Bluetooth TX to PIN 10**

![connection](/static/images/wireless-tethering/hc-05-setup.png)

And also locate the KEY pin of the HC-05. This is important since this is where the code does its magic to send AT commands:

![key-pin](/static/images/wireless-tethering/key-pin.png)

Then open up your Arduino IDE and stick this code:

```c
#define ROBOT_NAME "RandomBot" // This will be the Bluetooth name the HC-05 is set once setup is complete.
                               // You can change this to anything you like.

// If you haven't configured your device before use this
#define BLUETOOTH_SPEED 38400 //This is the default baudrate that HC-05 uses
// If you are modifying your existing configuration, use this:
// #define BLUETOOTH_SPEED 57600

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

// Swap RX/TX connections on bluetooth chip
//   Pin 10 --> Bluetooth TX
//   Pin 11 --> Bluetooth RX
SoftwareSerial mySerial(10, 11); // RX, TX

/*
  The possible baudrates are:
    AT+UART=1200,0,0 -------1200
    AT+UART=2400,0,0 -------2400
    AT+UART=4800,0,0 -------4800
    AT+UART=9600,0,0 -------9600 - Default for hc-06
    AT+UART=19200,0,0 ------19200
    AT+UART=38400,0,0 ------38400
    AT+UART=57600,0,0 ------57600 - Johnny-five speed
    AT+UART=115200,0,0 -----115200
    AT+UART=230400,0,0 -----230400
    AT+UART=460800,0,0 -----460800
    AT+UART=921600,0,0 -----921600
    AT+UART=1382400,0,0 ----1382400
*/

void setup() {
  // I added a 10 second delay before it does the AT setup to the bluetooth module
  // so I still have time to dip in a jumper wire from PIN 9 to the KEY PIN.
  delay(10000);
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);  // this pin will pull the HC-05 pin 34 (key pin) HIGH to switch module to AT mode
  digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for Leonardo only
  }
  Serial.println("Starting config");
  mySerial.begin(BLUETOOTH_SPEED);
  delay(1000);

  // Should respond with OK
  mySerial.print("AT\r\n");
  waitForResponse();

  // Should respond with its version
  mySerial.print("AT+VERSION\r\n");
  waitForResponse();

  // Set pin to 0000
  mySerial.print("AT+PSWD=0000\r\n");
  waitForResponse();

  // Set the name to ROBOT_NAME
  String rnc = String("AT+NAME=") + String(ROBOT_NAME) + String("\r\n");
  mySerial.print(rnc);
  waitForResponse();

  // Set baudrate to 57600
  mySerial.print("AT+UART=57600,0,0\r\n");
  waitForResponse();

  Serial.println("Done!");
}

void waitForResponse() {
    delay(1000);
    while (mySerial.available()) {
      Serial.write(mySerial.read());
    }
    Serial.write("\n");
}

void loop() {}
```

Assuming you have done the required connection, **run the code and manually connect a jumper wire to PIN 9 of your Arduino to the HC-05 KEY PIN**.

You have 10 seconds to do that.

After 10 seconds the TX LED of your Arduino should blink every second for 6 seconds.

If you've done this right you should see an output in your Serial Monitor similar to this:

```bash
Starting config
OK
OK[VERSION]
OK
OK
OK
Done!
```

Otherwise change the **value of `BLUETOOTH_SPEED`** in the code. In my case I had to change 38400 to 9600 since I formerly did stuff with my HC-05.

There should be no `ERROR(0)` shown in the Serial Monitor. If there is do the setup again.

## Uploading the Firmata

Without changing any of the connections open another tab in your Arduino IDE and copy the code in this [link][firmata]

Then Upload as usual to you Arduino.

## Changing the connection

Next setup this connection with Bluetooth RX to PIN 1(TX) and Bluetooth TX to PIN 0(RX)

![hc-05-port](/static/images/wireless-tethering/hc-05-port.png)

For extra measure press the reset button on your Arduino for 11 Seconds.

## Bluetooth in Host (Linux Only)

First in your HOST machine download blueman:

    sudo apt-get install blueman

Then open blueman and you should see this window:

![base](/static/images/wireless-tethering/blueman.png)

Click on Adapters --> Preferences and then set Visibility Setting to Always Visible

![Adapter](/static/images/wireless-tethering/adapter.png)

Then select the name of the HC-05 Bluetooth. Its what you set in the `ROBOT_NAME` during the AT setup. In my case its `POF_ROBOT`.

![Selection](/static/images/wireless-tethering/blueman.png)

Then click setup and pair with it. The default pin should be `0000`:

![Setup](/static/images/wireless-tethering/setup_1.png)

The most important part is the connection. **Select the Serial Port option**:

![Setup2](/static/images/wireless-tethering/setup_2.png)

In Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and provided you didn't switch to another desktop manager shortly after pressing next you should see a notificaiton telling that bluetooth device is now open in `/dev/rfcomm#`.

Usually in the first run it should be `/dev/rfcomm0` unless you've got other bluetooth devices that are communicating over as a serial port.

### Running some code

Run these commands:

```js
mkdir j5
cd j5
npm init // Walk through the setup
npm install johnny-five
```

And then create a file called `board.js` with the following contents:

```js
var five = require('johnny-five')
var board = new five.Board({
  port: '/dev/rfcomm0',
})

// The board's pins will not be accessible until
// the board has reported that it is ready
board.on('ready', function () {
  console.log('Ready!')

  var led = new five.Led(13)
  led.blink(500)
})
```

Remember to change the `/dev/rfcomm0` if you've got other bluetooth as serial port devices connected.

The run using `sudo node board.js`. The LED in PIN 13 should keep on blinking until you press `CTRL-C`.

_Notes: If it gives you a timeout error, press the reset button on your Arduino for 11 seconds. That should do the trick._

## End

This is by no means an exhaustive guide, but rather on what I did to get HC-05 Bluetooth to work as a serial port in my case since the guide didn't tell everything.
