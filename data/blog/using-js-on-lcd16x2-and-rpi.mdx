This post will cover how to use NodeJS to display the current time in the format of `h:mm:ss a` through an [16x2 LCD Display][2] with a [Raspberry Pi 3][3].

This was the result of what I made:

## Software Dependencies

Make sure you're Raspberry Pi has [NodeJS][nodejs] installed in it.

If not then download and install it.

## The Materials

In order to follow along with this tutorial you will need the following:

**Required**:

- Raspberry Pi
- Assorted Jumper Wires
- 10k ohm potentiometer
- 220 ohm resistor
- Any HD44780 Compatible LCD. Mine is [this][this]
- Breadboard

_Optional_:

- [Cobbler for Raspberry Pi][cobbler]

> I listed the cobbler as optional because you can opt to use jumper wires instead. The cobbler just makes it easier to work with GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi.

## The Schematic

> I'll only show the Schematic for now since I'm not really good at using [Fritzing][fritzing] to display the Graphical Connection.

![Schematic Diagram](/static/images/lcd-post/schematic-lcd.jpg)

This diagram only has a minor difference from the [Adafruit Schematic on the Subject][adafruit-tutorial]. It has a 220 ohm resistor through the anode since the lcd I've used doesn't have builtin resistors.

> Please refer to the [Adafruit Schematic][adafruit-tutorial] for the correct schematic incase I've got this one wrong.

## Code

Run the following commands using your terminal or command-line:

```bash
mkdir lcd-clock
cd lcd-clock
npm init
```

Run through the npm prompts and then install the [lcd][lcd-package] and [moment][moment] package using npm:

```bash
npm install lcd moment
```

The [lcd][lcd-package] allows you to have a high-level API in controlling the LCD in NodeJS through the Raspberry Pi while [moment][moment] is used for better date and time formatting.

Then create your `lcd.js` file with the following contents in it:

```js
const Lcd = require('lcd')
const moment = require('moment')
const lcd = new Lcd({ rs: 25, e: 24, data: [23, 17, 21, 22], cols: 16, rows: 2 }) // These pin numbers must reflect the schematic.

lcd.on('ready', () => {
  setInterval(() => {
    lcd.setCursor(0, 0)
    lcd.print(moment().format('h:mm:ss a'), (err) => {
      if (err) {
        throw err
      }
    })
  }, 1000)
})

process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  lcd.close()
  process.exit()
})
```

If you want to edit what to display in the lcd just replace the first argument in the `lcd.print()` method

> For more information on the lcd module's methods visit its [github repo][lcd-package]

Then run `lcd.js` through node:

```bash
node lcd.js
```

And you should see the time through the LCD:

An example of Displaying an extra line to the LCD:

```js
const Lcd = require('lcd')
const moment = require('moment')
const lcd = new Lcd({ rs: 25, e: 24, data: [23, 17, 21, 22], cols: 16, rows: 2 })

lcd.on('ready', () => {
  setInterval(() => {
    lcd.setCursor(0, 0)
    lcd.print(moment().format('h:mm:ss a'), (err) => {
      if (err) {
        throw err
      }
      lcd.setCursor(0, 1)
      lcd.print('Hello There!', (err) => {
        if (err) throw err
      })
    })
  }, 1000)
})

process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  lcd.close()
  process.exit()
})
```

> The Api of the lcd package does not do an automatic newline unlike the [Adafruit Python Library][adafruit-python]. If you miss out on putting the next `setCursor` and `print` in the previous print callback it won't be displayed on the lcd since the internal implementation of the module does not write if the given value can be overwritten. See this [test][test] for more info.

And the Output:

There are still alot more things you can do with this. You can replace the displayed text or make it scroll along the lcd. You're imagination is the limit.
